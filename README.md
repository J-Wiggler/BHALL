# BHALL

## Bad Hashing Algorithm Lol
As the name suggests, this is going to be a hashing algorithm that's probably not going to be very great. Basically, it might be semi-practical, but for the most part its just a proof of concept and is probably more insecure than a lock on a bathroom stall.

## Theory
A similar concept was attempted back in the old days of high school, but that wasn't just "not great"; it was bad. This came to me in linear algebra lecture, so you can probably guess that it's going to be a hashing algorithm using concepts of matrix determinants, because assuming I haven't learned nothing in that class, a determinant is pretty hard to revert back into the original matrix. For simplicity, for now, the algorithm will function on a 32 bit block size. It will probably (hopefully) be irreversible. There may well be collisions. The message digest probably wont even be constant, so by definition, this technically isn't even a hashing algorithm. At the very least, there is room for improvement.

## Justification
Imagine hashing something with BHALLs. I also must learn c++.
