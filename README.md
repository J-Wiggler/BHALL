# BHALL

## Bad Hashing Algorithm Lol
As the name suggests, this is going to be a hashing algorithm that's probably not going to be very great. Basically, it might be semi-practical, but for the most part its just a proof of concept and is probably not very secure nor collision-proof.

## Theory
A similar concept was attempted back in the old days of high school, but that wasn't just "not great"; it was bad. This came to me in linear algebra lecture, so you can probably guess that it's going to be a hashing algorithm using concepts of matrix determinants, because assuming I haven't learned nothing in that class, a determinant is pretty hard to revert back into the original matrix. For simplicity, for now, the algorithm will function on a 32 bit block size. It will probably (hopefully) be irreversible. There may well be collisions. The message digest probably wont even be constant. At the very least, there is room for improvement.

## Justification
Imagine hashing something with BHALLs.
